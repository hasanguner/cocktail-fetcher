# Cocktail Fetcher

Scraping all the cocktails, ingredients, instructions etc. from `https://www.thecocktaildb.com/`.


## Synopsis

Since `The Cocktail DB Api` does not provide all the cocktails and their details from one particular endpoint, fetching all the ingredients, and related cocktails with the details is required.
`Cocktail Fetcher` helps you to fetch all the data and stores into a json file with the well-formatted way.

## Motivation

I needed a data source regarding to cocktails, ingredients and recipes for my ongoing bartender-bot project. 

## Installation

Installation steps are as follows.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Run!

Once you have run the following command, after the operation is complete, all the data will be stored in the `repository.json` file.

```
$ npm start
``` 

## Tests

Use following instructions to run tests.

```
$ npm test
```
